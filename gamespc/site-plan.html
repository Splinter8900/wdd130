        WHY People will come to Gamerspace because they enjoy video games or are looking to get started gaming. People are looking for ways to get more information or to be able to find other players with similar taste, values, and skill levels. People want connections and friends and my website will be able to provide that. A problem that I personally often encounter when I am playing online, especially when I am playing competitive games which my website focuses on, is that I am often at a disadvantage when playing against people who know each other and are grouped up and have their own communication. I want to solve that problem by providing tools to help you find a group of your own. This way you can communicate and befriend these people which provides a huge advantage when playing online and mitigates the frustration that stems from playing with random people.

      <h3>Tips, Tricks, and Info</h3>
      <p>
        QUESTIONS	Visitors will be able to find answers to their questions such as, “How do I get started with competitive gaming?”, “Where can I find more information about this game I want to play?”, ”How and where can I find other players who play the same games as I so that I can have some friends to play with and communicate with?”
        WHO is this designed for? GamerSpace is a multifunctional website that provides for the professional player as well as the casual player who may be just starting out. For the experienced, the information on the site is always good to review even if it’s something you already know. And group finder tools can help you find other players at your skill level who have a common skill set and knowledge to match your personal prestige and abilities. For the noob, you will be granted useful tips and information and guides to starting out in the competitive gaming scene as well as using those same group finding tools to help you find friendly players who are always willing to lend a hand and show you the ropes. And for every player in between the two extremes there is always something for you to do in GamerSpace.

      <h3>Looking for Group</h3>
      <p>
        ACTIVITIES All of these questions will be answered by the pages and information on my website. There will be links to other websites and short form descriptions and information about various games that visitors can read. There will also be tips and tricks as well as tools to other platforms that can connect players virtually across the globe.
        NECESSARY INFO, There is no necessary info that is required to access my page and the actions my site offers. There will be many sites that are linked to in my website that will require registration of an account including email and other information but that will all be handled by the respective third party sites.
	      CONTENT Gamerspace is more like a hub and less a source of brand new material. Much of the information and many of the tools available on Gamerspace can be found elsewhere on the internet by their own, but what makes Gamerspace unique is that it gathers much of the information all to one source. Players will be able to visit the website and it will save them a lot of time searching around for whatever they are looking for and interested in and can instead conveniently find it all together and organized by my website. The main page will be the hub to the 2 children pages, it will also give general information about competitive gaming as a whole. One of the children pages will provide group finder tools and tips on the best way to approach and find other players. The other page will provide information about the most popular competitive games, some tips and tricks and how to best get started.
