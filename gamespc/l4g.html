            <p>
                Discord is a tool where users can create and join servers based around all sorts of different games and communities.
                On these servers users can interact with each other via text based chat rooms or voice and video chat rooms. Users can share content 
                with each other and can show each other what games they are currently playing and interested in. There are many servers that have chat rooms 
                based around looking for groups to play with. To use discord you just need to make a free account and search for the servers that you may be 
                interested in a join.

            <h2>Reddit</h2>
            <p> 
                Reddit is a huge collection of online forums. Users can create sub-reddits around any topic, which allows people to congregate and 
                share their own insights and ideas about said topics. Reddit can be used to get help or to help someone else out with what every they need 
                including gaming. It is almost a guerantee that every game out there has a sub-reddit and if there isnt one, you can be the one to make it.

            <h2>Twitch</h2>
            <p>
                Twitch is a streaming platform primarily used by the gaming community. Streamers can stream 
                whatever they are playing or doing onto the site for millions to watch and interact through the chat.
                The reason Twitch is included here is because you can find people with similar gaming interests while you 
                watch people play the games that you are interested in. Not only does this help you find people to play with
                but lets you learn the games by watching others play.
