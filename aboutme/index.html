    <h2>Ben Shurtz</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Ben and I am from Alberta, Canada!
        I really love videogames and parkour!</p>
    <p> I love heights and I am a bit of an adrenaline junky. I am currently working on 
        an applied technology degree but down the line may switch to 
        mecanical or electrical engineering.</p>
    <p> Who knows maybe I will just
        stick with web and computer programming as I am really enjoying it!</p>
    <p>I currently work at a Dairy Queen but hope to move on to something 
        that is a little more stable for supporting a future family!</p>
